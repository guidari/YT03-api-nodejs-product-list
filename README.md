## Product List

Video for the tutorial to build this API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE3IAkBRyBg&t=14s

In this video we are going to build a REST API from scratch using Node JS.

It will be a product list, so we can create, delete and update a product and of course we will be able to list all the products created.
